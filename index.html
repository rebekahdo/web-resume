    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <h5>My Books Application: Senior Project</h5>
    <h5>Fantasy Basketball Project: Personal Project</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>With the increasing popularity of fantasy sports, employing machine learning to determine a team’s likelihood of winning a game and predict a player’s fantasy point score can significantly enhance a user’s fantasy sports experience.         </li>
        <li>To predict the winning team, we will leverage features like the home team's home record and the away team's road record. This classification helps users make informed decisions while picking a team to win a game. To achieve the most accurate model, we will rapidly iterate through various models and features, identifying the ones with the most robust predictive power. We are currently employing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, but we will also consider other models such as Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes, and logistic regression, assessing their effectiveness through feature addition or removal.         </li>
        <li>In fantasy sports, forecasting a player's fantasy point score holds paramount importance. We will quantify fantasy points using ESPN's standard fantasy points format, associating points with various basketball statistics, such as points scored and rebounds. Our prediction model for a player's fantasy point score incorporates features like the player's average fantasy points over their last 20 games (or less, depending on the total games played), and the average fantasy points per minute the player's opposing team has conceded to the player's position, which we multiply by the player's expected minutes for the upcoming game, calculated based on their average minutes played over the previous two games. While our current model is based on linear regression for its effectiveness and interpretability, we remain open to the potential benefits of utilizing a neural network.         </li>
        <li>Our dataset was acquired through web scraping from basketballreference.com, using BeautifulSoup from the BS4 Python library. We will preprocess the dataset for machine learning using Pandas, while for our machine learning models, we will leverage the SciKit-Learn library. Should the need for a neural network arise, we will consider employing Keras.         </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Weather App: Class Project</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a weather application that is a user-friendly web-based tool designed to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information for both local and favorite locations. With its intuitive interface and seamless functionality, users can easily search for weather details and save their preferred locations for quick access. </li>
        <li>The Weather Application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and dynamic user experience. The HTML structure defines the layout and components, while CSS is utilized to style the application, ensuring an attractive and visually consistent interface. JavaScript handles the application's logic and functionality, including fetching weather data from a weather API, processing user input, and dynamically updating the user interface.</li>
        <li>The application utilizes AJAX techniques to communicate with the weather API, enabling real-time retrieval of weather information. The API response, typically in JSON format, is parsed and displayed on the user interface dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The application may eventually make use of a backend database to store and retrieve users' favorite locations, ensuring persistent data across sessions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Warehouse Employee Actions System: Personal Project</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Created a database system for inputting Employee information and daily dock actions which then outputs Employee quality reports and dock conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Wondering in The Woods: Class Project</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Wandering in the Woods Simulation is to teach K-8 students about computation, computational thinking, math concepts, and computer science in a fun and engaging way. </li>
        <li>The simulation/game is divided into three stages, each with increasing levels of complexity, targeting students from grades K-2, 3-5, and 6-8. </li>
        <li>The simulation aims to provide a consistent user experience across the different stages to facilitate the learning curve and build confidence in students. </li>
        <li>The simulation/game uses the concept of people being lost in the woods and needing to find each other, represented by a grid. By moving around the grid and finding each other, students will learn about statistics, spatial reasoning, and experimental design, among other concepts. </li>
        <li>The simulation/game is designed to be played by pairs of students working together in front of the same screen, with audio directions and prompts, and assessments to check how well the students are doing with the challenges.        </li>
    </ul>
